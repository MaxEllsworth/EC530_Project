# User Functionality

# Approach
<<<<<<< HEAD
The user functionality was modeled off of the device module code, in which Python's metaclasses enabled one class to return another class with custom class variables defined in JSON. In the instance of the device module, once the custom device class was instantiated (i.e. smartwatch, scale, etc.), it would then be saved as a .pkl (Pickle) binary. In this user case, instead of saving classes as Pickle binaries, it makes sense to save the user directly to a database
